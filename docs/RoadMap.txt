----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 v 1.0 Completion Requirements:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK - feature parity with 0.1 rc1
OK - store the game data into a single file
OK - game file format must be version numbered (each version will be a .h file)
OK - save format must be numbered (in the filename, not needed to be on file itself)
OK - configuration must be saved/loaded from file
OK - intensive testing and QA


SEQUENCE - Ape, Dynamite, Mage, Seahorse, Daisie, Techno, Mummy, Spike (Daisie, Seahorse, Ape x2, Spike)


--------------------------
VERSION 1.0.1
-------------------------
- PS2: add ISO/CD version




--------------------------
VERSION 1.0.2
--------------------------
- colorcycle out of sync sometimes
- get some free sound effects to replace Capcom ones


- projectile _target_position must take target width/heigth in account

- chain is bigger when facing direction right
- fix charging while passing through doors (keep charge)

- remove build warnings in PS2, PSP and Dingux
- EDITOR: clean editor code (find slots that aren't used anymore)
LOW - fix PSP build to use qmake
LOW - HP bars must not be drawn under 3rd level of tiles
- move all drawing methods such as hp-bar, icons, path, etc to draw class; so graphlib only deals with SDL making easier to change it to other graphical library
OPTIMIZATION:
	- OPTIMIZATION: use coverity
	- OPTIMIZATION: use cppcheck (plugin for qtcreator: http://qt-project.org/forums/viewthread/26113)
	- Optimize editor: in editor_area, do not alloc pixmaps every time, only when changing beaten flag or stage
	- check for ALL places in game that can use game_data directly instead of creating new instances
		- refactor code, so that "game_npcs" do not replicate(copy) data from game_data
		- refactor code, so npcs and players do not replicate(copy) CONST data from game_data, only DYNAMIC such as position, state and HP
	- use optimization tricks for SDL (http://osdl.sourceforge.net/main/documentation/rendering/SDL-optimizing.html)

--------------------------
