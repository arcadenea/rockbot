- não usar down+jump para slide, deve ser um botão (por causa do air dash)
- USAR A MESMA FÍSICA PARA OS 4 PLAYERS, O QUE DIFERENCA SÃO AS HABILIDADES
    - rockbot tem escudo e tiro carregado
    - betabot: leva -1 de dano, duplo tiro
    - candy: leva +1 de dano, atira na diagonal, pulo duplo
    - kittybot: leva +1 de dano, air-dash

- remove beaten graphics
- iniciar música do estágio apenas após "ready"
- selected_player começando em zero
- beta não está disparando segundo tiro (deve ter a ver com mudança de numero)
- coil item não está fazendo player pular
- armas especiais não fazem som ao ser disparadas
- player não volta para stand, fica em anim_WALK
- chefe não está caindo (teleport-in)
- chain is bigger when facing direction right
- texto mummy é tOmb e não tUmb :)
- cadeira de rodas IS deve ser IF
- no estágio do spike, quando tiver espinhos, mesmo de cabeça para baixo, usar o gráfico de espinhos mesmo, não dos cristais
- impedir de slide continuar segurando o botão
- coil e jet estão virando um energy-small após o teleport-in O.o
- Ape Quake: This one's fine for the most part, but I would suggest refining the rumbling effect and giving a sound cue as to when it's used.
- Dynamite Flash: This one is all right as well, though I could do without the delay when first using it (as in, everything stops and suddenly disappears for roughly a second, including you). Going off the Flash Stopper, the screen itself could just flash about twice, and the weapon would activate.
- Desert Storm: Make the homing function focus on the enemy closest to you, rather than the enemy furthest to the right on-screen.
- Petals Rainbow: Slow the projectile in general and give it a tighter arc (similar to Screw Crusher's, even if it does amount to being a carbon copy of it).
- Spiked Chain: Slow it down in general, make the chain a bit longer, and either give it about double the ammo it has now or just have it use less ammo in general.
- Magic Star: Make it capable of taking multiple hits before fading out, give the player control over firing it and which directions it can go in.
- Sonar Wave: Decrease its speed slightly, increase its damage output, and maybe have it bounce at multiple angles depending on how it hits a surface.
- Timed Bomb: Have the bomb fire forward instead of being placed, give the player control of when they can detonate it by pressing the button again, and have it explode on-contact with any enemy (with this set-up, I could tolerate and understand it bouncing off of shielded enemies).
- adicionar rostos da candy e kitty na seleção de estágios

    * _player_teleporter.active = false;
- nos teleportadores, quando vencer o chefe, recarregar energia do player (equivalente a uma capsula grande)
- se segurar direita, no primeiro teleporte do seahorse, sem pular, morre ao invés de teleportar
